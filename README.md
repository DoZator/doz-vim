DoZator's vim plugins.

Now this repo contains:

1. [NERDTree plugin](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)
  You can add this for NERDTree in .gvimrc file:

    	map <F2> :NERDTreeToggle<CR>

2. [Airline Vim](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) Lean & mean status/tabline for vim that's light as air.

Good luck in coding.
